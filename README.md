# CurvatureRadii
 Find the curvature radii of the oil blob along the circumstance

 The oil blob in the pore has different curvature radii at different places. This program computes the curvature radii at different places in the oil blob.

 1. find the oil-water interface
 2. use adjacent points to fit circles
 3. plot the histogram of the curvature radii
